Motivation: Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum The forced damped pendulum is an important example of a physical system that demonstrates complex dynamics, which arise from the interplay of damping, restoring forces, and external periodic driving forces. The motion of such a system can display a wide range of behaviors from simple harmonic motion to chaotic dynamics depending on the parameters. The pendulum\u2019s behavior is influenced by factors like the damping coefficient, driving force amplitude, and driving frequency. Understanding these behaviors is essential for applications in engineering and physics, such as energy harvesting, mechanical resonance, and vibration isolation. 2. Parameters for the forced damped pendulum q = 0.5 # Damping coefficient omega_0 = 1.0 # Natural frequency (rad/s) F = 1.0 # Amplitude of external force omega = 1.5 # Frequency of external force 3. Theoretical Foundation The equation of motion for the forced damped pendulum is given by: theta''(t) + q * theta'(t) + sin(theta) = F * cos(omega * t) where: - theta is the angular displacement - q is the damping coefficient - F is the amplitude of the external force - omega is the frequency of the external force For small theta, we can linearize the equation by approximating sin(theta) \u2248 theta: theta''(t) + q * theta'(t) + theta = F * cos(omega * t) The solution will have two components: a transient term that decays over time and a steady-state oscillation at frequency omega. Resonance occurs when the driving frequency omega matches the natural frequency of the system (omega_0), which is given by the formula: omega_0 = sqrt(1 - (q^2 / 4)) 4. Differential equation for the forced damped pendulum def forced_damped_pendulum(t, y, q, F, omega): theta, omega_theta = y dtheta_dt = omega_theta domega_theta_dt = -q * omega_theta - np.sin(theta) + F * np.cos(omega * t) return [dtheta_dt, domega_theta_dt] 5. Time range for simulation t_span = (0, 100) # From 0 to 100 seconds t_eval = np.linspace(0, 100, 10000) # 10000 points in time for a smooth solution 6. Initial conditions: [theta_0, omega_0] (small initial displacement, zero velocity) y0 = [0.1, 0] 7. Solve the ODE using scipy's solve_ivp (Runge-Kutta method) solution = solve_ivp(forced_damped_pendulum, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval, args=(q, F, omega)) 8.

The first plot shows the motion of the pendulum (Theta vs Time), which reveals how the pendulum's displacement changes over time. 2. The second plot is the Phase Space Plot (Theta vs Angular Velocity), showing the relationship between the angle and its velocity. This helps in understanding the system's periodic behavior. 3. The third plot, the Poincar\u00e9 Section, displays the system's dynamics in terms of periodic crossings at theta = 0, indicating periodic or chaotic behavior. 4. The Bifurcation Diagram shows how the system's dynamics change as the driving frequency (omega) is varied, which can reveal resonance and chaotic regions. 15. Practical Applications 1. Energy Harvesting: Used in vibrational energy harvesting systems to generate electricity from periodic motion. 2. Suspension Bridges: Forced oscillations can lead to resonance, causing catastrophic failures like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. 3. Electrical Circuits: Analogous to driven RLC circuits where the voltage and current oscillate. 16. Limitations and Extensions: 1. Nonlinear Damping: The model assumes linear damping, but real-world systems may have air resistance and other nonlinear effects. 2. Non-Periodic Forcing: External forces may be irregular in real applications, requiring stochastic or chaotic modeling.","title":"Problem 2: Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#problem-2-investigating-the-dynamics-of-a-forced-damped-pendulum","text":"import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp","title":"Problem 2: Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#1-motivation-investigating-the-dynamics-of-a-forced-damped-pendulum","text":"","title":"1.
