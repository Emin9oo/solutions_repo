## **Theoretical Background**
### **Newton’s Second Law and Equations of Motion**
The motion of a simple pendulum of length \( L \) and mass \( m \) under the influence of gravity, damping, and an external periodic force is governed by Newton’s Second Law:
\[
 m L \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = - mg \sin\theta - b \frac{d\theta}{dt} + F_0 \cos(\omega t),
\]
where:
- \( \theta \) is the angular displacement,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( b \) is the damping coefficient,
- \( F_0 \) is the amplitude of the external force,
- \( \omega \) is the driving frequency.

Rearranging, we get the nonlinear second-order differential equation:
\[
 \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \sin\theta = \frac{F_0}{mL} \cos(\omega t),
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{b}{m} \) is the damping factor.
